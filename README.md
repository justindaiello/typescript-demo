# TypeScript Demo

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that has optional static typing and compiles to plain JavaScript.

## Types

JavaScript has 8 types:
1. Undefined: the set with the only element undefined
2. Null: the set with the only element null
3. Boolean: the set with the two elements false and true
4. Number: the set of all numbers
5. BigInt: the set of all arbitrary-precision integers
6. String: the set of all strings
7. Symbol: the set of all symbols
8. Object: the set of all objects (which includes functions and arrays)

TypeScript brings an additional layer to JavaScript: _static types_. These only exist when compiling or type-checking source code. Each storage location (variable, property, etc.) has a static type that predicts its dynamic values. Type checking ensures that these predictions come true.

Detecting errors in code without running it is referred to as static checking. Determining whatâ€™s an error and whatâ€™s not based on the kinds of values being operated on is known as static type checking. TypeScript checks a program for errors before execution, and does so based on the kinds of values, itâ€™s a static type checker.

### Type annotation
A colon after a variable name starts a _type annotation_: the type expression after the colon describes what values the variable can have.

```javascript
let myNumber: number =  12
```

### Type Aliases
By using `type` we can create an alias for an existing type.
```javascript
type Age =  number

let myNumber: Age = 12
```
```javascript
type User = {
  name: string
  email: string
}

let myUser: User = { name: 'Bob Loblaw', email: 'bob@loblaw.com' }
```

### Function Types
We can check the type of the argument and the return type.
```javascript
const myFunc = (num: number): number => {
  return num + 1
}
```
