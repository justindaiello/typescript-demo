# TypeScript Demo

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that has optional static typing and compiles to plain JavaScript.

## Types

TypeScript brings an additional layer to JavaScript: _static types_. These only exist when compiling or type-checking source code. Each storage location (variable, property, etc.) has a static type that predicts its dynamic values. Type checking ensures that these predictions come true.

Detecting errors in code without running it is referred to as static checking. Determining whatâ€™s an error and whatâ€™s not based on the kinds of values being operated on is known as static type checking. TypeScript checks a program for errors before execution, and does so based on the kinds of values, itâ€™s a static type checker.

### Type annotation

A colon after a variable name starts a _type annotation_: the type expression after the colon describes what values the variable can have.

```typescript
let myNumber: number = 12;
```

### Type Inferences

Even though every storage location has a static type in TypeScript we do not always have to specify a type. TypeScript can often infer it.

```typescript
let myNumber = 12;
```

TypeScript can infer that `myNumber` is a static type of `number`

### Type Aliases

By using `type` we can create an alias for an existing type.

```typescript
type Age = number;

let myNumber: Age = 12;
```

```typescript
type User = {
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

let myUser: User = { name: 'Bob Loblaw', email: 'bob@loblaw.com' };
```

We can also use `interface` to accomplish the same thing. `type` cannot be reopened to add new properties while `interface` can be extended.

```typescript
interface User = {
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

let myUser: User = { name: 'Bob Loblaw', email: 'bob@loblaw.com' }
```

### Function Types

We can check the type of the argument and the return type.

```typescript
const myFunc = (num: number): number => {
  return num + 1;
};
```
